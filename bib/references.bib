  abstract = {The emerging prosperity of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, has come into the spotlight during the past few years. Cryptocurrency exchanges, which act as the gateway to this world, now play a dominant role in the circulation of Bitcoin. Thus, delving into the analysis of the transaction patterns of exchanges can shed light on the evolution and trends in the Bitcoin market, and participants can gain hints for identifying credible exchanges as well. Not only Bitcoin practitioners but also researchers in the financial domains are interested in the business intelligence behind the curtain. However, the task of multiple exchanges exploration and comparisons has been limited owing to the lack of efficient tools. Previous methods of visualizing Bitcoin data have mainly concentrated on tracking suspicious transaction logs, but it is cumbersome to analyze exchanges and their relationships with existing tools and methods. In this paper, we present BitExTract, an interactive visual analytics system, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to explore the evolutionary transaction patterns of Bitcoin exchanges from two perspectives, namely, exchange versus exchange and exchange versus client. In particular, BitExTract summarizes the evolution of the Bitcoin market by observing the transactions between exchanges over time via a massive sequence view. A node-link diagram with ego-centered views depicts the trading network of exchanges and their temporal transaction distribution. Moreover, BitExTract embeds multiple parallel bars on a timeline to examine and compare the evolution patterns of transactions between different exchanges. Three case studies with novel insights demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our system.},

  abstract = {Annually, money laundering activities threaten the global economy. Proceeds of these activities may be used to fund further criminal activities and to undermine the integrity of financial systems worldwide. For these reasons, money laundering is recognized as a critical risk in many countries. There is an emerging interest from both researchers and practitioners concerning the use of software tools to enhance detection of money laundering activities. In the current economic environment, regulators struggle to stay ahead of the latest scam, and financial institutions are challenged to ensure that they can identify and stop criminal activities, while ensuring that legitimate customers are served more effectively and efficiently. Effective technological solutions are an essential element in the fight against money laundering. Improved data and analytics are key in assisting investigators to focus on suspicious activities. Continually evolving regulations, together with recent instances of money laundering violations by some of the largest financial institutions, have highlighted the need for better technology in managing anti-money laundering activities. This study explores the use of visualization techniques that may assist in efficient identification of patterns of money laundering activities. It demonstrates how link analysis may be applied in detecting suspicious bank transactions. A prototype application (AML2ink) is used for proof-of-concept purposes.},

@article{Leite2020Hermes
  abstract = {The economy of a country can be modeled as a complex system in which several players buy and sell goods from each other. By analyzing the investment flows, it is possible to reconstruct the supply chain for the production of most goods, whose understanding is important to analysts and public officials interested in creating and evaluating strategies for informed and strategic decision making, for instance, adjusting tax policies. Those networks of players and investments, however, tend to be complex and very dense, which leads to over-plotted visualizations that obfuscate precious information such as the dependencies between productive sectors and regions. In this paper, we propose Hermes, a guidance-enriched Visual Analytics environment (named after the Greek God of Commerce) for the exploration of complex economic networks, to uncover supply chains, regions’ productivity, and sector-to-sector relationships. With practical knowledge regarding guidance, we designed and implemented a visual sub-graph querying approach to extract patterns from such complex investment graphs obtained from real-world data. We present a three-fold evaluation of the system: we perform a qualitative evaluation of our approach with three domain experts, a separate assessment of the proposed guidance features with an expert researcher in this field, and a case study of Hermes using a bank account network dataset to demonstrate the generalizability of our approach.},

The main challenge lies in the selection of effective factors towards excess market returns. Existing approaches, either hand-picking factors or applying feature selection algorithms, do not orchestrate both human knowledge and computational power. This paper presents iQUANT, an interactive quantitative investment system that assists equity traders to quickly spot promising financial factors from initial recommendations suggested by algorithmic models, and conduct a joint refinement of factors and stocks for investment portfolio composition. We work closely with professional traders to assemble empirical characteristics of “good” factors and propose effective visualization designs to illustrate the collective performance of financial factors, stock portfolios, and their interactions. We evaluate iQUANT through a formal user study, two case studies, and expert interviews, using a real stock market dataset consisting of 3000 stocks × 6000 days × 56 factors.},

@article{Guo2022RankFIRST
  abstract = {In the era of quantitative investment, factor-based investing models are widely adopted in the construction of stock portfolios. These models explain the performance of individual stocks by a set of financial factors, e.g., market beta and company size. In industry, open investment platforms allow the online building of factor-based models, yet set a high bar on the engineering expertise of end-users. State-of-the-art visualization systems integrate the whole factor investing pipeline, but do not directly address domain users' core requests on ranking factors and stocks for portfolio construction. The current model lacks explainability, which downgrades its credibility with stock investors. To fill the gap in modeling, ranking, and visualizing stock time series for factor investment, we designed and implemented a visual analytics system, namely RankFIRST. The system offers built-in support for an established factor collection and a cross-sectional regression model viable for human interpretation. A hierarchical slope graph design is introduced according to the desired characteristics of good factors for stock investment. A novel firework chart is also invented extending the well-known candlestick chart for stock time series. We evaluated the system on the full-scale Chinese stock market data in the recent 30 years. Case studies and controlled user evaluation demonstrate the superiority of our system on factor investing, in comparison to both passive investing on stock indices and existing stock market visual analytics tools.},

In order to present visually appealing and easy-to-read stacked graphs, this paper constructs the minimum cumulative variance rule to determine the stacking order of each dimension, as well as adopts the width priority principle and the color complementary principle to determine the label placement positioning and text coloring. In addition, a color matching method is recommended by user study. The proposed optimal visual layout algorithm is applied to the visual analysis of actual multidimensional financial time series data, and as a result, vividly reveals the characteristics of the flow of securities trading funds between sectors.},

@article{Maçãs2022Fraud
  abstract = {Fraud detection is related to the suppression of possible financial losses for institutions and their clients. It is a task of high responsibility and, therefore, an important phase of the decision-making chain. Nowadays, experts in charge base their analysis on tabular data, usually presented in spreadsheets and seldom supplemented with simple visualisations. However, this type of inspection is laborious, time-consuming, and may be of little use for the analysis and overview of complex transactional data. To aid in the inspection of fraudulent activities, we develop ATOVis – a visualisation tool that enables a fast analysis and detection of suspicious behaviours. We aim to ease and accelerate fraud detection by providing an overview of specific patterns within the data, and enabling details on demand. ATOVis focuses on applying visualisation techniques to the Finance domain, specifically e-commerce, contributing to the state-of-the-art as the first visualisation tool primarily specialised in Account Takeover (ATO) patterns. In particular, the present paper incorporates: a task abstraction for detecting a specific financial fraud pattern – ATO; two models for the visualisation of ATO; and a multiscale timeline to enable an overview of the data. We also validate our tool through user testing, with experts in fraud detection and experts from other fields of data science. Based on the feedback provided by the analysts, we could conclude that ATOVis is an efficient and effective tool in detecting specific patterns of fraud which can improve the analysts’ work.},

  abstract = {Modelling the dynamics of a growing financial environment is a complex task that requires domain knowledge, expertise and access to heterogeneous information types. Such information can stem from several sources at different scales, complicating the task of forming a holistic impression of the financial landscape, especially in terms of the economical relationships between firms. Bringing this scattered information into a common context is, therefore, an essential step in the process of obtaining meaningful insights about the state of an economy. In this paper, we present Sabrina 2.0, a Visual Analytics (VA) approach for exploring financial data across different scales, from individual firms up to nation-wide aggregate data. Our solution is coupled with a pipeline for the generation of firm-to-firm financial transaction networks, fusing information about individual firms with sector-to-sector transaction data and domain knowledge on macroscopic aspects of the economy. Each network can be created to have multiple instances to compare different scenarios. We collaborated with experts from finance and economy during the development of our VA solution, and evaluated our approach with seven domain experts across industry and academia through a qualitative insight-based evaluation. The analysis shows how Sabrina 2.0 enables the generation of insights, and how the incorporation of transaction models assists users in their exploration of a national economy.},
